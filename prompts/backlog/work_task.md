# Work a task (generic)

- Add an implementation plan to the Backlog task before changing files.
- Prefer Backlog MCP tools for task updates when available.
- Use `occt-lsp` MCP tools for symbol lookup to keep notes grounded.
- Keep changes limited to `notes/`, `tools/`, Backlog task files, and workflow prompts.
- Never modify anything under `occt/`.
